# Objectives of Analysis 

Forming a competitive national team is a complex process. The aim of this report is to assist this process via two main components. First, an outline of the method of selecting team players by analysing the player data available. Second, a forecast of the economic gains to Rarita generated by having a competitive team. Specifically, in terms of selecting players, a boosting regression was implemented to predict player salaries based on skills relevant to their position. For economic forecasting, a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model was utilised to predict future revenues. Following from these analyses the report will outline a general implementation plan over the next ten years, list the assumptions used in the models, as well as consider the risks involved and the data limitations present.  

# Team Selection

## Competitiveness

Competitive viability for team selection as follows: 

- Maintain a sound financial standing, generating profits to boost the economy over the next 10 years 
- Build a skilled team by choosing the best players using our selection criteria defined below 

## Selection Criteria 

The rationale behind player selection is centred around salaries. Specifically, whilst player salaries are known, the approach taken assumes that some players are overpaid or underpaid based on their skills and performance. According to a study conducted by Togler & Schmidt, salary has a significant predictor of a player‚Äôs performance (2007) [1]. Hence, a Gradient Boosting Machine Regression (GBM) was used to predict skill-based salaries. 

Recognising the relation between salary and skill, we use the GBM to choose the highest paid and under-priced players for every position as shown in figures below. All high salary players belong to countries ranking in the top 10 tournament standings to boost the ‚Äúcompetitiveness‚Äù of our team. Furthermore, we have also chosen young and the most under-priced players to maintain a competitive team throughout the next 10 years, while remaining financially sustainable (shown below). We have also included at least 1 Raritan national for every position, to promote the sport within the country (shown below).

## Probability of Being Competitive 

A logistic regression was implemented for relevant statistics in each position to predict the probability that an individual player would be on a competitive team.

The probability results are as follows:

Table 2.1 

Average Pr(Competitive team) = 0.596645664 



A majority of players have a probability greater than 80% of being part of a competitive team. There exist a few players with low probabilities (chosen based on their under-priced salary relative to performance). However, they are greatly outnumbered and may improve as explained below. 

Positive peer effects can enable lower probability players to increase their probability of competitiveness through the influence of higher probability players. This can be supported by the labour economics literature. According to MIT professor Daron Acemolu (2017), peer effects may have a positive externality [2] that improve the performance of lower performing participants within a group. If the players‚Äô utility functions exhibit submodularity, that is, negative cross partial derivatives, we can expect lower probability players to be positively influenced by most higher probability players. This will increase overall team competitiveness through time.  

## Revenues & Expenses generated from a competitive team

We have used Holt-Winters forecasting, a time series method to predict the future revenues based on historical data provided. This method assigns exponentially decreasing weights to older values, keeping our results relevant, and as better to data without an obvious trend or pattern [3]. 

Inflation was predicted using exponential forecasting over the next 10 years and used in all calculations (Appendix A2). 



|YEAR |Revenue (‚àÇmillions) |Expenses (‚àÇmillions) |Salaries (‚àÇmillions) |Profits (‚àÇmillions) |
| - | - | - | - | - |
|1 |410 |289.5 |191.3 |121 |
|2 |420 |294.2 |194.9 |126 |
|3 |430 |298.2 |199.0 |132 |
|4 |440 |300.6 |203.3 |140 |
|5 |450 |301.7 |207.9 |148 |
|6 |460 |300.6 |212.1 |159 |
|7 |470 |298.8 |216.4 |171 |
|8 |480 |296.1 |221.0 |184 |
|9 |490 |292.3 |225.3 |198 |
|10 |500 |288.1 |229.5 |212 |
Table 2.2 

Using the spot rates provided and assumption (1), the Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated (Appendix A2). Results shown below for: 

TOTAL NET PRESENT VALUES (‚àÇMillions) 



||SALARY |1,953.8 |
| :- | - | - |
||REVENUE |4,230.7 |
||EXPENSES |2,764.2 |
||PROFITS |1,466.6 |
Table 2.3 

We will not be loaning out players from our country as to preserve national competitiveness. Furthermore, our models have predicted that we have approximately 47% of our budget remaining after considering all direct team expenses for the next 10 years.   

# Economic Impact 

## Impact on GDP 

According to Keynesian economic theory, an increase in one of the components of aggregate demand (AD) will lead to a multi-fold increase in total GDP through the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect encapsulates the idea that once spending is distributed, it flows on into other channels of the economy.  

Applying this framework will illuminate how a competitive football team can improve Rarita‚Äôs GDP and economic performance overall. The football team‚Äôs profits will increase AD through consumption and/or investment, and thus increase total GDP by a greater amount 

via the multiplier. A multiplier of 1.7 has been calculated for Rarita‚Äôs economy using the GDP and household savings rate data given (Appendix A1). Using the projected profits of the football team, this multiplier will determine the total increase in the country‚Äôs GDP. The results to total GDP are shown below: 



|YEAR |PROFITS  (‚àÇ Millions) |Impact to Total GDP (‚àÇ Millions) |Impact to Total GDP |
| - | :- | :- | - |
|1 |121|205.7 |‚àÇ2.49B |
|2 |126|214.2 ||
|3 |132|224.4 ||
|4 |140|238 ||
|5 |148|251.6 ||
|6 |159|270.3 ||
|7 |171|290.7 ||
|8 |184|312.8 ||
|9 |198|336.6 ||
|10 |212|360.4 ||
Table 3.1 

The total impact to GDP was projected to have a NPV of ‚àÇ2.49B using cashflows discounted by spot rates with yearly yield to maturity for 2021. 

## Universal Healthcare Access Initiative 

The establishment of Rarita‚Äôs football team also provides the Raritan government a unique opportunity to address some of the structural societal issues the country is currently facing. More specifically, the government can begin to tackle the large disparity in healthcare spending across Rarita‚Äôs three provinces.  

It has been observed that despite West Rarita comprising of 60% of Rarita‚Äôs total population, it only represents 16% of the nation‚Äôs total healthcare spending in 2020. The underfunded nature of West Rarita‚Äôs healthcare system is demonstrated in its ‚àÇ460 healthcare spending per capita, in stark contrast to East and Central Rarita, at ‚àÇ4,979 and ‚àÇ2,839 respectively.  

It was initially assumed that reinvestments of proceeds from the Raritan football team, in addition to other pertinent factors impacting provincial economic growth would naturally address this issue. However, empirical analysis shows that West Rarita‚Äôs marginal propensity to spend on healthcare is only at 3.5%. This is contrasted to Central Rarita‚Äôs driven commitment to developing their healthcare system at 10.9%, and East Rarita‚Äôs strong 4.8%, despite currently retaining ‚àÇ4,979 in healthcare spending per capita (over 10 times West Rarita‚Äôs equivalent figure). As such, it is possible that prosperous economic growth could actually worsen the healthcare inequality.  

When analysing the impact of a lump sum subsidy to West Rarita‚Äôs healthcare in 2030, we observe that allocating 70% of the Raritan football team‚Äôs projected surplus increases healthcare spending per capita by 40% 

This investment impact was less material than expected, with West Rarita currently projected to have a healthcare spending per capita at only 36% of the projected national average. As such, it is suggested that the fund be the beginning a long-term initiative for structural reform in addressing the current inequitable access to healthcare. 

The ‚ÄúUniversal Healthcare Access Initiative‚Äù would involve restructuring the healthcare system to become more centralised, to capitalise upon the previously misallocated distribution of spending. Nationalising the healthcare system reduces the need for, and complexity of external investment. In 2030, it is projected that a national healthcare system would require to grow by ‚àÇ9.89B in order keep up with population growth and maintain current national healthcare spending per capita levels. This figure represents 47% of the Raritan football team‚Äôs forecasted profits in 2030 dropping from 79% in 2021, suggesting that the Raritan football team could serve as a potential long-term fund source in order to maintain national healthcare spending per capita, and allow the government to maintain its obligation to provide equitable access to healthcare. 

# Implementation Plan 

## Implementation Timeline

**Metric 1. Reassessing the FSA champion team (i.e., that scored the first position) against the chosen Rarita‚Äôs team through critical attributes that are crucial in players across all the positions.** 

Key Reporting Assessment:  

- We will be completing yearly assessments of key attributes of the top three teams as 

the performance indicators for Rarita‚Äôs football team across the following positions: 

1. Shooting: Standard SoT, Standard SoT%, Standard SoT90/Sh90, Standard G/SoT  
1. MidFielder: Total Cmp%, Total TotDist, Short Cmp%, Medium Cmp% and Long Cmp% 
1. Goalkeeping: Performance GA, Performance Save%, Performance CS%, 

Penalty Kicks Save%, Playing Time 90s. 

4. Defence: Tackles TklW/Tackles TKl, Tackles Def 3rd, Tackles Mid 3rd, Tackles Att 3rd, Vs Dribbles Tkl%, Vs Dribbles Past, Pressures %, Pressures Def 3rd, Pressures Mid 3rd, Pressures Att 3rd, Blocks Sh, Blocks ShSv, Blocks Pass 

Solution:  

- Personalised training programs for players in need of specific training  
- Assess whether new coaches or trainers are required to ensure training is successful 

Schedule of reporting: End of every FSA Championship League. 

**Metric 2. Keep track of over and underpriced salaries using GBM to ensure financially viability.**  

Key Reporting Assessment:  

- Adding the previous year‚Äôs data to the current information used for our modelling, where a new predictive salary must be estimated. As a result, there can be two of the following outcomes: 

Outcome 1. Predictive salary is lower than the Current salary as per the contract of the player 

Outcome 2. The predictive salary is higher than the player‚Äôs current salary  

Solution:  

Outcome 1: In this instance, the contract details (provided in the Assumptions section (3)) stipulates that the country has the power to provide the team‚Äôs individuals with a 2- month warning to show that they are working towards increasing their performance. If not, considerations will be made to reduce the player‚Äôs salary.  

Outcome 2: This will ensure that the plan is going as per the proposed strategy, and the players can be provided with yearly bonuses.   

Schedule of reporting: At the beginning of every new year. 

**Metric 3. Ensuring that all players‚Äô overall probability of competitiveness is increased by 10% at every championship league over the next ten years compared to their initial 59%.**  

Key Reporting Assessment:  

- Yearly friendly test matches between Rarita and the top ten countries that will participate in the championship. Based on the friendly matches, we will ensure an increase in competitiveness. We will aim for a 70% win rate in 2023. By 2026, we aim to win all friendly matches, which will also drive the success rate of Rarita winning the FSA championship.  

Solution: 

- Customised training for each player  
- Incorporate the critical attributes shown by winning players in each position into our customised training program. The cost associated with this training programme is given in Assumption 8. 

Schedule of reporting: Beginning of every year. 

**Implementation Process:**  

This depicts the ACC implementation of the identified metrics.  

![Aspose Words 27e20f33-eb6d-4efe-8a9a-c53b3fcd9610 006](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103352579/162608663-340e981f-1c3d-4591-b256-91f79df3af72.jpeg)

Figure 4.1 

Note: Appendix A6 breaks down the budget allocation for the implementation timeline across the different key metrics identified in the analysis above.  

# Assumptions 
- Average staff expenses to total expenses were found to be 66% for all other countries. Assuming staff expenses majorly consists of salaries, we have replicated this ratio in calculating expenses & salaries (Appendix A2) in the table above.  
- Assume a multiplier effect of 1.7, given the calculations performed (Appendix A3). 
- The players have signed a lock-in contract that prevents them from quitting. However, the contract is contingent on their performance where the country retains the right to reduce their yearly salaries with a 2-month warning notice before taking any action.  
- No government mandated lockdowns or restrictions.  
- Players can play for countries other than their nationalities. 
- Rarita‚Äôs revenue follows the trends of the top ten current nations. 
- Rarita‚Äôs economy is suitably similar to that of the other top ten nations. 
- The cost of training excluded from calculating expenses. 
- Players will remain over a tenure above ten years (hence players younger than 27 years old). 


# Risk Mitigation Strategies 

## RCD Tool with Risk Mitigation Response (Qualitative Risks) 

|Risk Category |Risk Division |Definition |Risk Mitigation Strategy |
| - | - | - | - |
|Operational |Health: Pandemic |Infect Rarita‚Äôs players and management staff |Reduce: Hire 5 substitutes to mitigate the risk of a shortage of players |
|Operational |Human resources: labour |Players leave for another team |Remove: Establish lock-in contracts for all players |
|Operational |Human resources: labour |Injured players |Reduce: Employ physiotherapists to treat injuries and substitute players |
|Operational |Security: terrorism |Terrorist attack in Rarita football stadium |Reduce: Hire security staff on grounds during matches and training |
|Strategic |Competition: outperformed |Other teams outperform Rarita out of the top ten |Retain: accept risk due to the intrinsic nature of the industry and appeal of the sport |
|Strategic |Competition: high-profile player  |Rarita competes against a team with a superstar player who drastically reduces their chance of winning |Exploit: use as a marketing opportunity to raise the stakes and generate a larger fan following |
|Strategic |Economic |Unforeseen recession reduces tourism demand |Reduce: implement expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to recover the economy |
|Financial |Liquidity  |Liquidity risk if cash flows become negative |Reduce: raise capital from investment banks and other non ‚Äì governmental funding  |
Table 6.1 

## Risk Map for Qualitative Risks: 

![Risk Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103352144/162609731-ea4fabc6-c6d2-49f6-bcf0-111dc114185e.png)

As illustrated in the diagram above, the qualitative risks have an ideal trade-off between impact and likelihood. Furthermore, the risk map illustrates the impact and likelihood 

before risk mitigation is implemented. Hence, after these strategies are implemented, it is expected that these likelihoods will fall significantly. In the case of ‚ÄòPlayer Leaves‚Äô, likelihood will fall to zero, due to the introduction of lock-in contracts. 

## Quantitative Risk: Implementation Modelling Risk 

The quantitative risk considered was the accuracy of the salary models. Two models (GBM, MLR) were fitted, and model selection was determined using MSE and goodness-of-fit  graphs.

Table 6.2 

Both models use 2020 salaries as the training dataset and 2021 salaries as the testing 

dataset. The test results are depicted in the graphs and tables above. As indicated in Figures 6.1 and 6.2, the goodness-of-fit of the GBM outperforms that of MLR. Furthermore, as shown in the table, whilst most positions have comparably similar MSEs, the Midfielder MSE for MLR is considerably larger than for GBM. For these two reasons, the GBM was chosen for modelling skill-based salaries. 

# Data and Data Limitations 
- Data cleaning has been performed by using multicollinearity matrix (Appendix A5). Furthermore, noise in the data has been reduced by eliminating/modifying data accordingly (Appendix A4). 
- Missing data has been imputed as tournament averages. 
- Only four years of data was provided for Holt-Winters forecasting, which did not allow for the detection of any seasonality.  
- The tournament data for players consisted of variables that had more than 80% of missing values (for e.g., Standard Dist). These variables were removed from consideration.  

# Appendix 

## A1: Logistic Regression Model for Pr(Competitive) 

These probabilities were averaged to create a metric for overall team competitiveness. 

Competitiveness was quantified by a categorical proxy variable labelled Top10, where: 

1,ùëñùëì ùëùùëôùëéùë¶ùëíùëü ùëñùë† ùëñùëõ ùëé ùë°ùëúùëù 10 ùë°ùëíùëéùëö ùëáùëúùëù10 =\

This Top10 variable was the dependent of the logistic regression, with the explanatory 

variables being the relevant skill columns for the position. For example, the goalkeeping 

logistic regression modelled was as follows: 

Pr (ùëáùëúùëù10 = 1|ùíô) = Œõ(ùõΩ4 + ùõΩ5ùê¥ùëîùëí + ùõΩ6ùëÉùëôùëéùë¶ùëñùëõùëîùëáùëñùëöùëí90ùë† + ùõΩ7ùëÉùëíùëüùëìùëúùëüùëöùëéùëõùëêùëíùê∫ùê¥ +

## A3: Calculating Rarita‚Äôs multiplier 

Standard macroeconomic theory indicates that the multiplier can be computed by: 

1

ùëò =

ùëÄùëÉùëÜ

Where k=the multiplier and MPS = the Marginal Propensity to Save. The MPS indicates the 

proportion that is saved for every extra unit of income. Hence the intuition for this formula is that the greater one‚Äôs MPS, the less money continues to flow through the economy. Therefore, a greater MPS will result in a lower multiplier.  

To compute Rarita‚Äôs MPS the following formula was used: 

ùê∂‚Ñéùëéùëõùëîùëí ùëñùëõ ùëÜùëéùë£ùëñùëõùëîùë† ùëÄùëÉùëÜ = 

ùê∂‚Ñéùëéùëõùëîùëí ùëñùëõ ùêºùëõùëêùëúùëöùëí

Which was determined using the economic data given by:
